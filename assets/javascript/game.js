It turns down the volume when a signal becomes louder than a set level and turns it back up when the signal drops below that level.", "Often a twofold effect: either to provide a gain boost that pushes a tube amp into distortion, or to approximate the mildly distorted sound of a slightly peaking tube amp. In practice, most do a little of both.", "A process commonly used to alter the frequency response of an audio system using linear filters. Most hi-fi equipment uses relatively simple filters to make bass and treble adjustments.", "This effect ecords short passages played on an instrument and plays them back on repeat", "An effect created when a sound or signal is reflected causing a large number of reflections to build up and then decay as the sound is absorbed by the surfaces of objects in the space â€“ which could include furniture, people, and air."];
